1. See code below
2. See code below
3. See code below, The models are barely equal, but i wold prefer MLP because it has a f1 score.
4. A simple technic is to use ngram.  An N-gram means a sequence of N words. So for example, “Data Science” is a 2-gram (a bigram), “A data science couse” is a 4-gram, and “Data science tutorial” is a 3-gram (trigram). 
5. See code below
6. In this case, ngrams didn't improve the model (it could be due to the amount of data used, or the construction of our dataset)
