lasso L1 norm -> When feature is highly correlated it could see its weight affected to zero
Ridge L2 norm -> When feature is highly correlated it could see its weight too small too close to zero but not zero
Elastic Net : combines ridge and lasso

About the unicity:

Lasso L1 non unique solution because L1 is not differentiable at zero
Ridge L2 unique sum of two convexe functions so unique solution
Elastic Net as combination of L1 and L2 the solution is not unique
