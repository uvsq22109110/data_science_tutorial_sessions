### Task

1. What is 2D Convolution ?
2. Define these concepts : Padding, Stride ? 
3. What is the benefit of the Padding ?
4. What is the rule to compute the output dimension ? 
5. What is pooling ? Name different types of pooling.
6. What is a Dropout ? How did it works.
7. What is a bounding box ?
8. What are the tasks that you can perform using a CNN, give an example for each task
9. Code a class Conv2D using only numpy lilbrary. The class should also take these optional parameters : Stride, Padding (Valid,Constant, Same). Test you class on this image. <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/638/1*APsEcslehRkCD9IXq6P2Mw.jpeg"></a> with this kernel. Plot & interpret the results <br/>
``` Python
kernel = np.array([[0, -0.5, 0], [-0.5, 3, -0.5], [0, -0.5, 0]])
```
